File description:

system.vhd 		the testbench of ipmux. To be used for simulation.
				### Note that this simulation needs a revision since the ipmux interface changed ###
				### due to the connection to clb_wrpc!                                           ###
fpga.vhd		the file to used for synthesis in the KC705 FPGA for test purposes
				### Note that this file isn't there since the ipmux interface changed due to the ###
				### connection to clb_wrpc!                                                      ###

modules:
