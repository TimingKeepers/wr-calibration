File description:

clb_wrpc_tb.vhd	the testbench of clb_wrpc. To be used for simulation.
fpga.vhd		the file to used for synthesis in the KC705 FPGA for test purposes


modules:
clb_wrpc	the top level of clb whiterabbit firmware use for integration of the clbv2.
			Note that an IBUFDS_GTE2, BUFG and MMCME2_ADV must be added for
			clk_sys_i and clk_gtx_i generation  (see fpga.vhd for an example)
	

Lower level modules:
	clb_wr_core 	the top level of whiterabbit firmware(wrpc).


Note that these files are generated by EASE.
